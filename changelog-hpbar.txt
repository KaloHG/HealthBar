Added: Config to show last damage taken.
Fixed: Mod not working at all if not on server-side.

1.0.2
Added: Update checker
Fixed: A server-side crash

1.0.1
Added: A config GUI! Change config options through the mods menu, without restarting your game! (In 1.7.10, you must be on the main menu, not in a world.)
Added: Config to replace vanilla health. The bar will be positioned and sized appropriately, ignoring related configs. No need to enable ShowAlways, but it won't hurt anything.
Added: Config to set the "justification" of the health bar.
Changed: Quiver (shaking on low health) now changes the scale of the health bar a bit as well.
